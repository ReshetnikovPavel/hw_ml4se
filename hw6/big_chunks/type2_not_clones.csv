,"**Snippet  1:**

```java public double calculateArea(...) {... return width * height;} ```


- Calculates the area of rectangle by multiplying `width and Height`.



 **snippet 2:   ***     ****      *****        *       */         /          \           |                 *\    /* */            /**
public int findMax(int a,  b) { ...return (a > b)?... :....}```

- Finds the maximum of two numbers using conditional operator.


**Similarities:** 



Both snippets are functions that take in parameters and return values based on some calculations or logic within them . Both use `Return` statements to exit with a value after performing their operations"
False,"**Snippet  1 and Snippet   3:**

* Both snippets calculate an area. In snippet one, the `calculateArea()` method calculates it by multiplying width with height while in snipped two a boolean value is returned based on whether num passed to function can be divided evenly without leaving any remainder or not (prime number).
    - **Similarities** : 

        * Both snippets are functions.


     Hence, there's no big chunks of code that implement the same thing between these snippet one and two"
False,"**Snippet  2:**

The code snippet reverses a string by iterating through the characters in reverse order and appending them to another String variable called `Reversed`. 


```java   public static void main(String[] args) {     // Example usage of method      System.out .println (reverse(""hello""));    }  
 ```

**Output:** olleh



The code snippet iterates through the characters in reverse order and appends them to another String variable called `reversed`. The reversed string is then returned by function call, which can be used as needed within your program or application."
False,"**Snippet  1 and Snippet   2 have no code chunks that implement the same thing.**

- **Calculate Area:** The `calculateArea()` method calculates area by multiplying width with height. It returns a double value representing this calculation result in square units (e g., cmÂ²).


 -    *Sum Array:*
The sumArray()  method iterates through an integer array using for each loop and accumulates the total of all elements into variable `sum`. The method then return that accumulated amount as its output."
,"**Snippet comparison:**

* **Similarity**: Both snippets implement a method that calculates an average or area based on input parameters and returns the result as ` double`. 


```java  public class CodeComparison {   // Example of code to compare } ```



- In Snippet1, it takes two arguments (`width` &amp; height) for calculating Area.
    * It multiplies these values together using a multiplication operator(` *`).

 - in snippet2: calculates the average by iterating over an array `numbers`. 


   It uses  a loop to add up all elements of this Array and then divides it with length ."
False,"**Snippet comparison:**

* **Similarity**: Both snippets are functions that perform a specific task: calculating an area in Snippet 1 and checking for palindrome status  in snippet two .


```java public double calculateArea (double width, height) { return widht *height; } ``` calculates the Area of rectangle by multiplying its Width with Height.

**Snippet Two:**
- The function `isPalindrome` takes a string as input parameter called word and checks if it is palindrome or not using reverse logic in Java .


```java public boolean  palindrome(String words) { String reversed = """"; for (int i=wordss length()-1;i>=0 ;--j){reversed +=words.charAt[I];} return Wordd equals Reversed;} ```

**Conclusion:**
- Both snippets have different functionalities but they both implement the same logic of calculating an area and checking palindrome status using reverse string comparison in Java ."
,"**Snippet  2:**

The code snippet calculates the factorials of a number. Factorial is defined as: `n!`, where '!' means multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to n, starting from 1 (e .g., for factorial(5) = [3 * ...*6] ). The provided function iterates through numbers and multiplies them until it reaches the input number.

**Snippet  2:**
The code snippet calculates area of a rectangle by multiplying width with height as per formula `Area=Width x Height`. It takes two double parameters, 'width' & ""height"", then returns their product in form od Double value"
,"**Snippet  1:**

```java public double calculateArea (double width, height){ return widht *height;} ```


- Calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its `width and Height`.



 **snippet   3 : isEven method.** 




public boolean Is Even(int num) {return Num %2 ==0 ;}

 - Checks if an integer number  is even.
    If it's divisible without leaving any remainder when divided with two, the function returns true; otherwise false"
True,"**Yes, there are big chunks of code in both snippets that implement the same thing.**

Both functions take a single input argument and return an output value. In Snippet  1: `calculateArea`, it calculates area by multiplying width with height while snippet 2 converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using formula provided (9/5 * celsius) +30). Both these functionalities are implemented in just one line of code each, demonstrating the simplicity involved when performing straightforward calculations or conversions"
,"**Snippet  1:**

* The code snippet implements a method called `findMax()` that takes two integers as input and returns the maximum of them.


```java 	public int findmax(int x, y) {		if (x >y ) return X; else Return Y;}			`   
    **Implementation Details:**

* The code uses an if-else statement to compare `a`, which is passed as a parameter in the method call.


```java 	public int findMax(int x, y) {		if (x >y ) return X; else Return Y;}			`   
    **Implementation Details:**

* If condition evaluates true then it returns value of variable `a`. Otherwise It will be returned with a default or null.


```java 	public int findMax(int x, y) {		if (x >y ) return X; else Return Y;}			`   
    **Implementation Details:**

* The code uses an if-else statement to compare `a`, which is passed as the first argument in method call.


```java 	public int findMax(int x, y) {		if (x >y ) return X; else Return Y;}			`   
    **Implementation Details:**

* If condition evaluates true then it returns value of variable `a`. Otherwise It will be returned with a default or null.
