While both use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and close resources properly upon completion or error handling in finally block they have different functionalities: 


* **Snippet1:** Reads data from a URL using `BufferedReader`, parses it into string buffer then stores answer.
    It handles malformed URLs, I/O errors by setting the 'answer' field with appropriate messages and returning early to avoid further execution of code in case an error occurs during reading or parsing process


* **Snippet2:** Copies data from a resource file specified using `resourceFilename` into another location (destination filename)

False,"**No.**

The two code snippets are different in their purpose and functionality: 


- Snippet1 is a Java method that implements the SHA hashing algorithm to generate an hexadecimal encoded string from input source. It uses MessageDigest, EncodeUtils library for encoding bytes into hex strings  and logger statements throughout its execution process

False,"**No.**

The two code snippets are not clones of each other because they have different purposes and functionalities:

False,"**No, the code snippets are not clones.**

Snippet 1 is a Java test case that tests an exception handling mechanism in gadget specification caching. It uses mock objects and expectations to simulate bad parsing of gadgets specifications from URLs specified by `SPEC_URL`. The goal here seems more focused on testing functionality related specifically within this module or class, rather than being generic code snippets with broader applicability across different contexts

Snippet 2 is a Java method that handles file access operations. It uses exception handling and throws custom exceptions to handle potential errors during opening URLs as input streams for files accessed through the `url` field of an object instance (assumed here). This snippet appears more general in its purpose, applicable within broader scenarios involving URL-based resource retrieval or data streaming from external sources

While both snippets involve using try/catch blocks and handling exceptions differently based on specific conditions. The overall logic flow is different between them due to their distinct functionalities: testing vs file access operations"
False,"**No, the code snippets are not clones.**

While both methods copy data from one file to another using streams and channels or IOUtils library functions respectively , they have different functionalities: 


- **Snippet1:** Copies entire files by transferring bytes between FileChannel objects. It handles closing resources explicitly in a try finally block
 -** Snippet2 :  Extracts resource embedded within the application jar.** This method extracts specific file from an internal location to another external directory using InputStream and OutputStream, handling close operations with nested `try` blocks"
False,"**No.**

The two code snippets are not clones of each other because they have different functionalities and use cases: 


- Snippet1 is a method that retrieves data from an API using HTTP GET request, while snippet2 copies files between locations."
False,"**No, the code snippets are not clones.**

While both use MessageDigest and BaseEncoding to generate a hashed value from an input string: 1) Snippet one uses MD5 algorithm with UTF-8 encoding.  2.) The second snippet employs SHA encryption using ASCII character set for text conversion before hashing"
False,"**No.**

The two code snippets are not clones of each other because they have different functionalities and implementations:


- **Snippet1:** Copies a file by transferring its contents from the source to destination using FileChannel objects. It handles exceptions, closes resources properly in finally block for efficient resource management.. 



 -  
** Snippet2 : Copy entire directory structure.**

It recursively copies an existing folder's content into another location while preserving their original relative paths and file structures"
False,"**No.**

The two code snippets are not clones of each other because they have different purposes and functionalities: 


* **Snippet1:** This snippet implements a method called `scramble420()` that takes in password, seed as parameters. It performs cryptographic operations using the SHA-5 algorithm to generate an output byte array based on these inputs
    

 *  **snippet two.** The code is used for testing purposes and it checks if one string contains another within its content by reading from a stream into memory then comparing them"
False,"**No, the code snippets are not clones.**

While both generate a hash value for an input string using MessageDigest and convert it to hexadecimal format in `toHex()` method of Snippet 1 or through formatting with Formatter object as seen  in getMD5Hash() function. However:


- **Algorithm:** The first snippet uses SHA2 algorithm, while the second one employs MD4 hash generation technique
 -**Output length**: Both generate a string representation but have different lengths due to their respective algorithms' output size"
False,"**No, the code snippets are not clones.**

While both codes use Java and involve file operations related to PDF documents or DICOM files in some way (Snippet 1 for signing PDFs while Snippet  2 converts them), they have different functionalities. The first snippet focuses on digital signatures of a specific type called ""SignedPdf"", whereas the second one is about converting ACRNEMA stream data into another format, potentially involving image processing and metadata modifications within DICOM files"
